Summary
🎉 MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!

I have successfully tested and demonstrated the functionality of your complete 8-bit microprocessor system. Here's what we achieved:

✅ Complete System Verification
Assembler Functionality:

✅ Both original and corrected assemblers working
✅ Successfully assembled multiple test programs
✅ Generated proper hex files for memory initialization
Hardware Simulation:

✅ All individual components tested (CPU, ALU, Memory, I/O)
✅ Complete system integration verified
✅ Programs execute correctly in simulation
Critical Issue Resolution:

✅ Identified instruction encoding mismatch between assembler and CPU
✅ Created corrected assembler matching CPU expectations
✅ Verified fix through successful program execution
Comprehensive Testing:

✅ Simple test program: Load, Add, Output, Halt - SUCCESS
✅ Comprehensive test: Multiple operations - SUCCESS
✅ System demonstrates: R0=20, R1=15, proper halt functionality
