I have added two screenshots, the first one is from teh SimulationLog tab

The next one is from the Hex Tab..

The Hex Tab decodes the instructions correctly - it used the Assembled Opcides directly - so the accuracy is very good.

Where as the simulation log tab, parses the logs and then decodes.. I think the algorith to parse it might pick up some words from logs - In fact, even that was helpful for me and was able to fix issues - but having a litle bit clear parsing will help eveb more - I feel the immediates are not correct - I could be wrong or there are some oter issues.. I want that to be resolved.

In the simulation logs tab, for evert instructionjs executed I see two entries in the decoded instructions grid.. probably my processor log statements needs revision..

Logically, this is what I expect.

1. Do as many passes on the logs.
2. Have a master list of each instruction. We may need to add a clear marker in the log - can be done in the cpu core, so that the logs are machine parsable.
3. For each instruciton, there could be many logs - have them rady
4. Each instruction has a clear PC, IS and decoded values, register values during the start of the IS Cycle, End Values after the instruction is executed. - Gather them
5. Since the actual register/mem writes happens in the next cycle, you may need to look the next instruction to see what was actually changed.
6. Please add as many markes as you need - I want the machine to parse the execution log and reason it.


I want enhance the Simulation Log Tab UI, so that I can also see the logs if wanted.. The UI is already full, so we need a clever way. 

On top of the current debug experience, I want to add another panel to show details for a specific instruciton, As mentioned in the earlier steps, we would have gathereed a master list of all instructions executed and logs, register details and all orther info for each of them. WE can presnet all of them in the nwe panel, muuch clearly.

I would be happier if we can multi screen UI, the current IDE and a detachable UI to debug a specific instructions. If I have three monitors that will be perfectly good. In my Laptop, I have mac, so I can move the instruction debugger to abother workspace. The challenge is, the Simulation Log View and the current UI will be in the promary UI, and the new panel will be in the secondary.

If we are able to achive that, I would like to detach the framebuffer also if requirued.. some anumations are bigegr, so I want to see both the simulation progress and the monitor.. Also that can mimic a eral monitor.. Later we can group the UART, Simulate a Keyboard mouse easily using the detacged panel

First lets brainstorm
