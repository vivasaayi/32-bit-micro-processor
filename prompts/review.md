Can you perform a comprehensive review of my processor..

I want a 32 bit processor, with the capability to execute data structure and algorithms. I also want to run a very somple linux kernal.

As part of that, i want to make sure that I can write C Programs, Compile to assembly, and execute it.,

can you analyze the processor and tell me,
1. Is the Memory management looks goo?
2. What is the addressable memory? Am I meeting the industry standards?
3. Do I have sufficient data bus width, word size, etc
4. Have I implemented Sufficient instruction sets?

I have built a C Compiler, Assember that uses my custom instruction sets, and a test runner that will be able to orchestrate the execution pipeline. You can find them in the tools.

What are the other top 10 items that our processor should support? Do I have it?
