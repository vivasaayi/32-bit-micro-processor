Goal: I want the capability to load and execute Java Programs in my RISC processor.

I have implemented a small Java byte code interpreter.. That is a seperate git repo and uses standard C toolchain and executable in Mac.

What I want is, I want the same byte code interpreter to be compilable via my own C Compiler, and executed via my RISC processor.

What I have,
1. I have simple java programs: in this folder: /Users/rajanpanneerselvam/work/hdl/AruviJVM/examples
2. I have Byte code converter: /Users/rajanpanneerselvam/work/hdl/AruviJVM/tools/bytecode_converter.py
3. Existing JVM interpreter: /Users/rajanpanneerselvam/work/hdl/AruviJVM/src


What I need,
1. Compile the JVM interpreter using my C Compiler: /Users/rajanpanneerselvam/work/hdl/tools/c_compiler.c
2. Assemnle the JAM interpreter using my assembler: /Users/rajanpanneerselvam/work/hdl/tools/assembler.c
3. Create a test bench that will load the JVM interpreter, along with wihch bytecode program to execute, follwoing the existing exammples /Users/rajanpanneerselvam/work/hdl/c_test_runner.py, /Users/rajanpanneerselvam/work/hdl/run_one_test.sh
4. Demonstrate the Java programs can be interpreted in my RISC Processor.

Along the lines,
1. I want to enhance my RISC instruction set - So make a clear case for the change, document it and make the change.
2. My assembler should be updated to match the RISC instruction set without breaking existing code - Also I am open to change existing code if you think they need modification - make a case, document it and do it
3. Enhance my Compiler

Looks like we are still trying to convert byte code to C and then execute..

What I really wanted is run my JVM in the processor..

/Users/rajanpanneerselvam/work/hdl/jvm is my JVM - I moved this folder.. This is capable of executing a JAVA byte code.

Can you compile this JVM using my compiler and run the JVM using my RISC processor


Ah, I understand now! You want to compile the actual JVM interpreter (written in C) using your custom C compiler and run the JVM itself on your RISC processor. The JVM will then load and execute the Java bytecode directly.

Let me explore your JVM directory and create a pipeline that:

Compiles Java → bytecode
Compiles your JVM interpreter (C) → RISC assembly
Runs the JVM on your RISC processor with the bytecode as input

Now I need to create a simplified version of this JVM that works with our C compiler constraints. Let me create a version that doesn't use structs, malloc, or arrays - similar to what we did before but now it will be a complete JVM.

Enahnce our Compiler and RISC processir as required

I'll enhance our C compiler and RISC processor to support the features needed to run the JVM. Let me analyze what's needed and implement the enhancements systematically.

Based on my analysis, I can see that the JVM uses several C features that our current C compiler doesn't support:

Arrays (int array[], uint8_t array[])
Structs (typedef struct, pointer access with ->)
Dynamic memory allocation (malloc, free)
Multiple variable declarations per line (int a, b, c;)
Function pointers and complex types
