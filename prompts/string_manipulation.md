I want to see if I can make the program to return a strung message..

The idea is, every program will be able to generate log statements and that can be returned as a final output..

that way, I can understand the code path taken by the program.

In addition to the INT results currently its returning, we should be able to return a string (or abillity to inspect the address agfter the program commpleted and retrive teh string from the memoryt)
Define a Strung var at the start of evert progam
After each line, update the string with what it did
4> Before the program returns make sure the mem is updated so that we can retrive the string var (or a suuitable optiomn)
Udpathe test runner, so that the runnner retrives and show the string in the result
Provide me a way I can see what ws the inpit, outpiut, string etc
