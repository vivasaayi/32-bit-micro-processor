I want to perform some more cleanup.

1. I want to store the the test programs in a dedicated folders.. Then within that folder, I want to have a fodler for C programs and a folder for assembly programs..

The test can be run using C  or assembly folders..

Any temporary files generated should go to the temp folder..

Even the compiler and the assembler should be compiled and placed in the temp folder
