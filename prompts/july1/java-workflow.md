I want to build a Java UI, so that I can perform operations via UI.

I am imagining a full swing IDE, with support for multuple tabs withig tabs

I want to provide a menubar. 

The file menu will allow me to select a program from the /Users/rajanpanneerselvam/work/hdl/test_programs folder. I am expecting Java/C/Assembly/Hex/V/VVP/Simulation Log files.

Based on the file selected, the workflow will differ. But I want the IDE Tabs to show related workflows and I think the tabs can remain static.

These are the tabs I am thinking:
1. C Tab: will show the C file's content. If the selected file is not C, then disable this tab. This tab will also provide buttons to compile the c program. When I click compile, then it will use my custom compiler to compile the program and store the assembly (which will be then loaded by the assembler.). Show a text area to show the logs of the commands adn compiler results.
2. Java Tab: will show the Java file's content. If the selected file is not Java, then disable this tab. Also it will show a button to compile. When I compile, use JavaC to compile the program. This tab will also host another editor area which will extract the byte code and show it. There will be one more area which will explain the byte code - we need to implenent that byte code decoder/explainer. This way, i will know the what is the java prigram, what is the compiled byte code and the explanation of that byte code. Whch I can use to verify my custom JVM. Show a text area to show the logs of the commands adn results.
3. Assembly Tab: This tab will be enabled if the selected file is a C file or an assembly file. If the selected file is a C file, then it should show the compiled assembly (which is done in the C tab). If the selected file is an assembly file, then this tab will show the actual program. This file will show buttons to compile the hex. Also another text area, to show the assembly explanation. I think we can use an LLM (prefeebly local LLM) to explain the assembly progaram.
4. Hex Tab: This tab will be always shown. This will show the compiled hex. Also, I want another grid to show the decoded Hex (break it downt to opcode, registers etc). We need to build the decoder. We need to write a dissambler, or explainer - since we already have the assembler in C, we can use C to dissasemble - we need to show the result of the dissambler.  Also another button to explain the opcodes, verify correctness using an LLM (preferebky local LLM)
5. Simulation Tab: Within this tab, we need to show few tabs, One tab to show the V file and another to show the VVP file, generated by the test runner (currentlt using pythonm we can port that code to JAVA and make this as a primary flow) - or we update the test runner to accept new commands and we call the test runner. Also one main tab with button Simulate, which will actually execute the VVP file and show live logs. We need to show the result from UART (the implementation is pending - but expecting the processor/test bunch to dump results to UART so that we can show it live). I primarily want the register content to be shown. we can show it in a gird, If possonle, for each iteration, we will show the status of all registers + critical locations.
6. Simulation Log Tab: This tab will show the simulation Log results. 
7. Terminal Tab: This will host the Framebuffer viewer, and a Text Console Viere. We hve the framebuffer viewer implementation and we need to includeh here. We need to implement the text control console viewer
8. VCD Tab: Provide options to interact with the VCD file. I want to show the contents of memory.
