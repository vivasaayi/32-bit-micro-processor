I am able to naviage to the run-simulation only via teh menu bar. If I click the tab direcly, its disabled

If I run the Start Simulaiton I get below error:
Initializing simulation...
Starting VVP simulation: /Users/rajanpanneerselvam/work/hdl/temp/tb_02_arithmetic.vvp
SIM: VCD Error: temp/tb_02_arithmetic.v:164: Unable to open temp/c_generated_vcd/02_arithmetic.vcd for output.
Simulation completed with exit code: 1


Also, where are you writing the simulation log? when I go to the simulation tab, I cam not seeing teh log.

Also for all the text areas, C, Java, Assembly, Hex, Logs, V File, VVP file, can you add a label to show the exact file name? Also Is it possoble to provide a link, so that I click on that clink, the finder window opens that file location?

I see a dump mempry button in the simulation button? Am I supposed to run it after the simulation? I see a log for Memory dump requested: 0x8000-0x8100 but dont see any result saying dumped, or what happens after
