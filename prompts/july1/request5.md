As per the screenshot I provided earlier, in the SimulationTab.java, can we remove all the nested tabs, and make the simulate tab contens to the parent?

Generate test bench button can be removed as we genrate the V files earlier - no need here. The only access we need is the V file name and the VVP file name.

Here here hve the start simulation button.. The functionality is simiar to the "Run Simulation" in the "V/VVP" tab. i want to keep it here.

please double check if I click start simulation button, the vvp file is executed and the simulation logs are generated..

Acutally, in the "V/VVP" tab, aftaer the run simulatiom, we are navigated to teh "Simulation Log" tab, intead, redirect to this tab, so that I can see the UART, logs, registers etc.
