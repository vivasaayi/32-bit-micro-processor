; Test CMPI (Compare Immediate) instruction
; This tests comparing a register with an immediate value

main:
    ; Test 1: Compare with zero
    LOADI R1, #5
    CMPI R1, #0      ; Should set N=0, Z=0 (5 > 0)
    STORE R1, 0x8000 ; R1 should still be 5
    
    ; Test 2: Compare with same value  
    LOADI R2, #10
    CMPI R2, #10     ; Should set N=0, Z=1 (10 == 10)
    STORE R2, 0x8001 ; R2 should still be 10
    
    ; Test 3: Compare with larger value
    LOADI R3, #3
    CMPI R3, #8      ; Should set N=1, Z=0 (3 < 8)
    STORE R3, 0x8002 ; R3 should still be 3
    
    ; Test 4: Compare with negative immediate
    LOADI R4, #15
    CMPI R4, #-5     ; Should set N=0, Z=0 (15 > -5)
    STORE R4, 0x8003 ; R4 should still be 15
