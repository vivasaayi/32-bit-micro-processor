# Processor Instruction Set Review - 2025-06-30

## Question: Does the system implement the RV32I instruction set?

### Review Summary

Based on the provided documentation in `DISPLAY_SYSTEM_README.md`, the system is a custom RISC processor with a display subsystem. However, there is no explicit mention of the RV32I (RISC-V 32-bit Integer) instruction set in the documentation. The following points summarize the findings:

### Findings
- The documentation refers to a "custom RISC processor" and describes its display, memory map, and software/hardware integration.
- There is no reference to "RISC-V", "RV32I", or any RISC-V standard instruction set in the provided documentation.
- The memory map, register names, and programming interface are custom and do not match the standard RISC-V register or CSR conventions.
- The CLI and demo programs use custom function names and memory-mapped I/O, not RISC-V standard instructions or ABI.
- No mention of RISC-V compliance, toolchain, or compatibility.

### Conclusion
**This processor does not claim or document support for the RV32I (RISC-V) instruction set.** It appears to be a custom RISC design with its own instruction set and memory-mapped I/O conventions.

#### Recommendation
- If RV32I compatibility is required, further investigation of the Verilog source (`cpu/`, `microprocessor_system_with_display.v`) and instruction set documentation (`docs/instruction_set.md`) is needed.
- As of this review, there is no evidence of RV32I support in the provided documentation.

## Extended Review: RV32I Compatibility (Verilog & ISA Analysis)

### Documentation and ISA
- The file `docs/32bit_instruction_set.md` describes a 32-bit microprocessor with:
  - 32 general-purpose 32-bit registers (R0-R31, R0 hardwired to zero, RISC convention)
  - 32-bit instructions, two main formats (register and large immediate)
  - Instruction set includes: LOADI, LOAD, STORE, ADD, ADDI, SUB, SUBI, AND, OR, XOR, SHL, SHR, CMP, JMP, JZ, JNZ, JC, JNC, JLT, JGE, JLE, HALT, etc.
  - Register naming and conventions are similar to RISC-V, but not identical.
  - No mention of RISC-V, RV32I, or standard RISC-V opcodes/encodings.
  - Immediate and instruction formats do not match RISC-V RV32I encoding.

### Verilog Source (cpu_core.v, register_file.v, alu.v)
- `register_file.v` implements 32x32-bit registers, R0 hardwired to zero (RISC-V style), but no explicit x0-x31 naming.
- `cpu_core.v` uses 5-bit register addresses, 32-bit data, and a 5-stage pipeline (FETCH, DECODE, EXECUTE, MEMORY, WRITEBACK), similar to RISC-V.
- Instruction decode and opcode mapping are custom (e.g., opcode = instruction_reg[31:27]), not RV32I encoding.
- ALU (`alu.v`) supports arithmetic, logic, shift, compare, multiply, divide, modulo, but opcodes and control are custom.
- No support for RISC-V compressed instructions, CSR instructions, or RISC-V system instructions.
- No mention of RISC-V privilege levels, standard exception/interrupt handling, or RISC-V ABI.

### Summary Table

| RISC-V toolchain       | No                      | Yes                   |
| RISC-V compliance      | No                      | Yes                   |

### Conclusion
**This processor is NOT RV32I compatible.**
- It is a custom 32-bit RISC design with some similarities to RISC-V (register file, pipeline, instruction types), but the instruction encoding, opcode mapping, and system features are not RV32I compliant.
- No evidence of RISC-V toolchain or binary compatibility.
- No mention of RISC-V compliance or support in documentation or source.

#### Recommendation
- If RV32I compatibility is required, significant changes to instruction encoding, opcode mapping, and system/CSR support would be needed.
- As of this review, the processor is a custom RISC design, not a RISC-V (RV32I) implementation.
