# Memory Subsystem LOAD/STORE Fix - Detailed Analysis

**Date:** July 16, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Components:** Memory Controller, CPU Core, Assembler  

## Problem Summary

The custom 32-bit CPU's memory subsystem had a critical bug where LOAD instructions were reading back incorrect data instead of the values previously stored by STORE instructions. STORE operations worked correctly, but LOAD operations returned instruction encodings or stale data rather than the stored values.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Initial Symptoms
- ✅ STORE instructions: Correctly wrote data to memory locations
- ❌ LOAD instructions: Read back wrong values (instruction encodings instead of stored data)
- ✅ Assembler: Correctly encoded LOAD/STORE immediate addressing
- ✅ CPU Pipeline: Properly executed memory operations

### Debugging Process

#### 1. Assembly Test Programs
Created simple test programs to isolate the issue:

**Test Program (`memory_test.asm`):**
```assembly
.org 0x8000

; Write test values
LOADI R1, #42
STORE R1, #0x0100
LOADI R2, #99
STORE R2, #0x0104

; Read them back  
LOAD R4, #0x0100
LOAD R5, #0x0104

; Write some different values
LOADI R3, #123
STORE R3, #0x0108
LOAD R6, #0x0108

HALT
```

#### 2. Simulation Analysis
Initial simulation showed:
- Memory writes: `DEBUG: Memory write at addr=0x00000100, data=0x0000002a` ✅
- Memory reads: `DEBUG: Memory data read at addr=0x00000100, data=0x0000002a` ✅
- CPU received: `DEBUG CPU: LOAD from addr=0x00000100, data=1076363524` ❌

**Problem Identified:** Memory controller was reading correct data, but CPU was receiving different values.

#### 3. Memory Controller Investigation

**Original Implementation Issues:**
```verilog
// PROBLEMATIC CODE - Registered memory output
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (cpu_mem_read && !cpu_mem_write) begin
        mem_data_out_reg <= internal_memory[cpu_addr_bus[19:2]];
    end
end

assign cpu_data_bus = cpu_mem_read ? mem_data_out_reg : 32'hZZZZZZZZ;
```

**Root Cause:** **Timing Race Condition**
1. Memory controller updated `mem_data_out_reg` on clock edge
2. CPU captured `data_bus` on the same clock edge
3. Register update and data capture created timing dependency
4. CPU received stale or incorrect data due to setup/hold violations

### Technical Analysis

#### Memory Access Timing Issue
```
Clock Edge N:
├─ Memory Controller: mem_data_out_reg <= new_data
├─ Data Bus: cpu_data_bus = mem_data_out_reg (old value)
└─ CPU: memory_data_reg <= data_bus (captures old value)

Clock Edge N+1:
├─ Data Bus: cpu_data_bus = mem_data_out_reg (new value)
└─ CPU: Uses memory_data_reg (still contains old value)
```

The memory controller was treating both instruction fetches and data reads identically, causing conflicts when the CPU was simultaneously fetching the next instruction and reading data.

## Solution Implementation

### Fix Strategy
**Convert memory reads from registered to combinational logic:**

#### Before (Problematic):
```verilog
// Registered approach - caused timing issues
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (cpu_mem_read && !cpu_mem_write) begin
        mem_data_out_reg <= internal_memory[cpu_addr_bus[19:2]];
    end
end

assign cpu_data_bus = cpu_mem_read ? mem_data_out_reg : 32'hZZZZZZZZ;
```

#### After (Fixed):
```verilog
// Combinational approach - immediate data availability
assign cpu_data_bus = (cpu_mem_read && accessing_internal_mem) ? internal_memory[cpu_addr_bus[19:2]] :
                     (cpu_mem_read && accessing_status_reg) ? status_register :
                     (cpu_mem_read && accessing_external_mem) ? ext_data : 32'hZZZZZZZZ;
```

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Memory Controller Changes
**File:** `processor/microprocessor_system.v`

**Key Changes:**
- Removed `mem_data_out_reg` dependency for read operations
- Made memory reads purely combinational
- Maintained write operations as registered (correct behavior)
- Preserved debug output for analysis

**Modified Logic:**
```verilog
// Memory controller - writes only
always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
    if (!rst_n) begin
        mem_ready_reg <= 1'b0;
        status_register <= 32'h00000000;
    end else begin
        mem_ready_reg <= 1'b1;
        
        if (accessing_internal_mem && cpu_mem_write) begin
            internal_memory[cpu_addr_bus[19:2]] <= cpu_data_bus;
            $display("DEBUG: Memory write at addr=0x%08x, word_addr=%d, data=0x%08x", 
                    cpu_addr_bus, cpu_addr_bus[19:2], cpu_data_bus);
        end
        
        // Debug output for reads (data provided combinationally)
        if (cpu_mem_read && !cpu_mem_write && accessing_internal_mem) begin
            if (cpu_addr_bus < 32'h00001000) begin
                $display("DEBUG: Memory data read at addr=0x%08x, word_addr=%d, data=0x%08x", 
                        cpu_addr_bus, cpu_addr_bus[19:2], internal_memory[cpu_addr_bus[19:2]]);
            end else begin
                $display("DEBUG: Memory instruction fetch at addr=0x%08x, word_addr=%d, data=0x%08x", 
                        cpu_addr_bus, cpu_addr_bus[19:2], internal_memory[cpu_addr_bus[19:2]]);
            end
        end
    end
end

// Combinational data bus assignment
assign cpu_data_bus = (cpu_mem_read && accessing_internal_mem) ? internal_memory[cpu_addr_bus[19:2]] :
                     (cpu_mem_read && accessing_status_reg) ? status_register :
                     (cpu_mem_read && accessing_external_mem) ? ext_data : 32'hZZZZZZZZ;
```

#### 2. CPU Integration
**File:** `processor/cpu/cpu_core.v`

**CPU Memory Interface:**
```verilog
// CPU captures data during MEMORY state
MEMORY: begin
    if (is_load_store && opcode == MEM_LOAD) begin
        memory_data_reg <= data_bus;  // Now receives correct combinational data
        $display("DEBUG CPU: LOAD from addr=0x%x, data=%d", immediate, data_bus);
    end
end
```

The CPU's memory capture logic remained unchanged - the fix was entirely in the memory controller timing.

## Verification Results

### Test Execution
**Program:** `memory_test.asm`

#### STORE Operations (Always Worked):
```
LOADI R1, #42    → R1 = 42
STORE R1, #0x100 → Memory[0x100] = 42 ✅

LOADI R2, #99    → R2 = 99  
STORE R2, #0x104 → Memory[0x104] = 99 ✅

LOADI R3, #123   → R3 = 123
STORE R3, #0x108 → Memory[0x108] = 123 ✅
```

#### LOAD Operations (Now Fixed):
```
LOAD R4, #0x100  → R4 = 42  ✅ (previously: wrong value)
LOAD R5, #0x104  → R5 = 99  ✅ (previously: wrong value)  
LOAD R6, #0x108  → R6 = 123 ✅ (previously: wrong value)
```

### Simulation Output (Post-Fix):
```
SIM: DEBUG CPU: LOAD from addr=0x00000100, data=42
SIM: DEBUG CPU Writeback: Writing 42 to R 4

SIM: DEBUG CPU: LOAD from addr=0x00000104, data=99  
SIM: DEBUG CPU Writeback: Writing 99 to R 5

SIM: DEBUG CPU: LOAD from addr=0x00000108, data=123
SIM: DEBUG CPU Writeback: Writing 123 to R 6
```

## Performance Impact

### Positive Impacts:
- ✅ **Faster Memory Access:** Combinational reads eliminate one clock cycle delay
- ✅ **Reduced Complexity:** Simpler memory controller logic
- ✅ **Better Timing:** Eliminates race conditions and setup/hold issues
- ✅ **Deterministic Behavior:** Memory reads are immediately available

### Considerations:
- **Combinational Delay:** Memory access now adds to critical path
- **Setup Time:** CPU must meet setup requirements for data capture
- **Fan-out:** Memory array directly drives data bus (acceptable for internal memory)

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Timing in Digital Design
- **Clock domain interfaces require careful analysis**
- **Registered outputs can introduce unwanted delays**
- **Combinational logic often preferred for immediate data availability**

### 2. Memory Controller Design
- **Read operations should be combinational when possible**
- **Write operations should remain registered for data integrity**
- **Instruction fetch vs. data access can share the same interface**

### 3. Debugging Methodology
- **Simple test programs isolate complex issues effectively**
- **Debug output at multiple levels (memory controller + CPU) crucial**
- **Simulation waveforms would have accelerated diagnosis**

### 4. System Integration
- **Interface timing between major components is critical**
- **Memory subsystem timing affects entire CPU performance**
- **Harvard vs. Von Neumann architecture considerations**

## Future Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Memory Controller
- **Add memory wait states for external memory**
- **Implement cache controller interface**
- **Add memory protection and virtual addressing**

### 2. Performance Optimizations
