# Commands Used for ADDI/SUBI Verification

## Build and Run Simulation

To build and run the default simulation and verify the system after implementing ADDI and SUBI instructions, the following command was executed from the project root:

```sh
make
```

This command:
- Compiles the hardware design and testbenches
- Runs the simulation
- Outputs debug logs and test results

## Notes
- Run this command in the `/Users/rajanpanneerselvam/work/hdl` directory.
- The simulation output will show debug logs for instruction execution, register writes, and ALU operations, confirming correct ADDI/SUBI behavior.
