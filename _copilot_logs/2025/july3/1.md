Summary of Enhancements
I've successfully implemented the requested debugging enhancements:

1. Always Decode Hex ✅
Removed the "Disassemble Hex" button from HexTab
Hex content is now automatically decoded when loaded
Uses the shared InstructionDecoder utility
2. Shared Instruction Decoder ✅
Created util/InstructionDecoder.java with common opcode mappings
Supports both hex file decoding and simulation log parsing
Generates human-readable instruction descriptions
3. Enhanced SimulationLogTab ✅
Three-panel layout: Simulation log, decoded instructions, and register state
Simulation log parser that extracts:
PC (Program Counter)
Opcode values
Register destinations (RD)
Register sources (RS1, RS2)
Immediate values (IMM)
Register writeback operations
Flag updates
4. Visual Register Highlighting ✅
Register table shows R0-R31, PC, and Flags
Green highlighting for registers changed by selected instruction
Interactive: clicking on an instruction in the decoded table highlights the affected registers
5. Decoded Instructions Table ✅
Shows: PC, OpCode, Mnemonic, RD, RS1, RS2, IMM, Description
Displays human-readable instruction names (ADD, LOAD, MOV, etc.)
Generates operation descriptions (e.g., "R1 = R0 + R2")
6. Both Tabs Show Decoded Instructions ✅
HexTab: Shows decoded static instructions from hex file
SimulationLogTab: Shows decoded dynamic instructions from simulation execution
Same table format and shared decoding logic
Key Features:
Real-time parsing of simulation logs
Interactive register tracking with visual feedback
Robust error handling for large register values
Consistent UI across both tabs
Automatic hex decoding without manual buttons
The enhanced IDE now provides much better debugging capabilities, allowing you to:

See exactly which instructions executed during simulation
Track register changes visually with green highlighting
Understand instruction flow and data movement
Compare static hex content with dynamic execution
All the requested functionality has been implemented and is ready for use!
