Summary
I have successfully fixed the compiler to handle local variables properly. Here's what I did:

✅ The Problem
The C compiler was generating assembly code that referenced undefined labels like [result] for local variables, causing the assembler to fail with "Invalid memory reference" errors.

✅ The Root Cause
Local variables were not being properly allocated on the stack. The compiler would:

Allocate stack space (sub sp, sp, #64)
But then generate references to undefined variable labels (store r1, [result])
Instead of using proper stack-relative addressing (store r1, [fp-12])
✅ The Fix
I modified the compiler's code generation to:

Track Variable Locations: Added a VariableLocation linked list to the CodegenContext to track each local variable's stack offset.

Stack-Based Allocation: Modified codegen_variable_decl() to:

Allocate variables at specific stack offsets from the frame pointer
Track these offsets in the variable location list
Stack-Relative Addressing: Modified codegen_assignment() and codegen_identifier() to:

Check if a variable is local (has a stack offset)
Generate [fp+offset] addressing for local variables
Fall back to [label] addressing for global variables
Function Scope Management: Added proper initialization and cleanup of local variable tracking for each function.

✅ Results
✅ 02_arithmetic.c now compiles and runs successfully
✅ All other test programs (01_hello_world, 03_complex_arithmetic, 04_division_test) continue to work
✅ Generated assembly now uses proper stack-relative addressing:
load r1, [fp-4] (loading variable a)
load r2, [fp-8] (loading variable b)
store r1, [fp-12] (storing to variable result)
The arithmetic test now works correctly with actual dynamic computation and variable storage, as you requested. The fix ensures that local variables are properly managed using stack-based storage while maintaining compatibility with existing functionality.
