Summary
The preprocessor directive skipping functionality is already implemented and working correctly in the lexer. Here's what's in place:

Implementation Details:
skip_preprocessor function in lexer.c:

Detects lines starting with #
Skips the entire line until newline or end of file
Properly handles the newline character
Integration in main tokenization loop:

Checks for # at the beginning of tokens
Calls skip_preprocessor() and continues to the next token
Placed before other token processing
Supported preprocessor directives:

#include <...> and #include "..."
#define statements
#pragma directives
#ifdef, #else, #endif blocks
Any line starting with #
Testing Results:
✅ Single preprocessor directives (#include <stdio.h>)
✅ Multiple consecutive preprocessor directives
✅ Mixed preprocessor directives with various types
✅ Preprocessor directives combined with function definitions
✅ Complex preprocessor patterns
The compiler successfully skips all preprocessor directives and continues parsing the actual C code without any issues. The generated assembly output confirms that only the C code is processed, with preprocessor lines completely ignored as intended.
