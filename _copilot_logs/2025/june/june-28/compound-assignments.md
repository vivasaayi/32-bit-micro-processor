ðŸŽ‰ Compound Assignment Implementation Complete!
âœ… Successfully Implemented Full Compound Assignment Support
New Features Implemented:

1. Lexical Analysis (Already Complete)
âœ… TOK_PLUS_ASSIGN (+=)
âœ… TOK_MINUS_ASSIGN (-=)
âœ… TOK_MUL_ASSIGN (*=)
âœ… TOK_DIV_ASSIGN (/=)
âœ… Proper tokenization and recognition
2. Parser (Already Complete)
âœ… Recognition of compound assignment operators
âœ… Proper precedence handling (same as regular assignment)
âœ… AST node creation with correct operator types
3. Type Checking (Enhanced)
âœ… Compound assignment validation: Both operands must be numeric types
âœ… Type compatibility: Enhanced checking for arithmetic operations
âœ… Error reporting: Clear error messages for invalid compound assignments
âœ… Regular assignment: Maintains existing functionality
4. Code Generation (Completely Rewritten)
âœ… Syntactic sugar expansion: x += 5 â†’ x = x + 5
âœ… Load-Modify-Store pattern:
âœ… Array support: arr[i] += value correctly handled
âœ… Register optimization: Efficient register usage
âœ… All operators: +=, -=, *=, /= properly implemented
Expansion Logic:
The compiler treats compound assignments as syntactic sugar:

Source Code	Expanded To	Assembly Pattern
x += 5	x = x + 5	load â†’ add â†’ store
y -= 3	y = y - 3	load â†’ sub â†’ store
z *= 2	z = z * 2	load â†’ mul â†’ store
w /= 4	w = w / 4	load â†’ div â†’ store
arr[i] += v	arr[i] = arr[i] + v	array_load â†’ add â†’ array_store
Test Results:
âœ… Basic Compound Assignments:

âœ… Array Compound Assignments:

âœ… Complex Expressions:

âœ… Type Safety:

âœ… Numeric type validation
âœ… Compatible type checking
âœ… Proper error messages
Integration with Existing Features:
âœ… Arrays: arr[index] += value works perfectly
âœ… Functions: x += func() supported
âœ… Ternary: x += (cond) ? a : b supported
âœ… Complex expressions: Full expression support in operands
Generated Assembly Quality:
Efficient load-modify-store pattern
Minimal register usage
Clear comments showing expansion
Proper handling of complex left-hand sides (arrays, etc.)
Real-World Impact:
Compound assignments are fundamental C idioms:

Accumulation patterns: sum += value
Counter updates: count++ equivalent to count += 1
Scaling operations: value *= factor
Buffer management: ptr += offset
Examples Now Supported:
The C compiler now supports essential compound assignment operators, significantly improving code expressiveness and matching real-world C programming patterns! ðŸš€
