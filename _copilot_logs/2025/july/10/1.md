I'll help you reorganize your opcodes to fit within the 6-bit range (0x00-0x3F). The issue is that your Set/Compare and System opcodes are using values above 0x3F, which don't fit in 6 bits.

Perfect! I've reorganized your opcodes to fit within the 6-bit range (0x00-0x3F). Here's what I changed:

**New Opcode Organization:**
- **0x00–0x0F**: ALU operations (16 opcodes available)
- **0x10–0x1F**: Memory operations (16 opcodes available) 
- **0x20–0x2F**: Control/Branch operations (16 opcodes available)
- **0x30–0x3F**: Set/Compare/System operations (16 opcodes available)

**Key Changes:**
1. **Memory opcodes**: Moved from 0x20-0x22 to 0x10-0x12
2. **Control/Branch opcodes**: Moved from 0x30-0x3B to 0x20-0x2B
3. **Set/Compare opcodes**: Moved from 0x40-0x45 to 0x30-0x35
4. **System opcodes**: Moved HALT from 0x50 to 0x3E, INT from 0x51 to 0x3F
5. **Updated all references**: Fixed hardcoded values throughout the code to use the new opcode constants

**Benefits:**
- All opcodes now fit within 6 bits (0x00-0x3F)
- No more truncation warnings
- Better organization with 16 slots per category
- Room for future expansion within each category

Your design now has a clean 6-bit opcode space that's fully utilized and well-organized!
