Summary
I've successfully addressed all the issues you mentioned:

✅ Fixed Issues:
Assembly file loading - The system was already correctly configured for output.s, but I enhanced error handling and path tracking

Simulation tab enabling - Updated the tab enabling logic so the simulation tab becomes enabled when VVP files are generated

VCD directory creation - Added automatic creation of c_generated_vcd directory before simulation starts

Enhanced simulation log - Improved log visibility with emoji indicators and better formatting

File name labels and clickable links - Added dynamic file path labels to all major tabs that show the exact file being edited and allow clicking to open the file location in Finder

Memory dump functionality - Enhanced the memory dump to provide actual formatted hex output and proper validation

✅ Key Improvements:
Clickable file paths in all tabs (C, Assembly, Simulation) that open in Finder/Explorer
Automatic VCD directory creation prevents simulation errors
Enhanced memory dump with formatted hex output
Better simulation log with clear status indicators
Improved tab enabling logic for simulation workflow
✅ Testing:
The IDE compiles successfully and all new features are ready to use. The "Generate Testbench" button was already implemented and working correctly with c_test_runner.py.

You should now have a much smoother experience with:

Clear file path information in all tabs
Clickable links to open file locations
Automatic simulation setup with directory creation
Enhanced memory dump with actual output
Better visual feedback throughout the workflow
