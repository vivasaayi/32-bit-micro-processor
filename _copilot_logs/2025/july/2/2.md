 All Issues Successfully Fixed!
I've successfully implemented all the workflow improvements you requested for your Java Swing IDE:

âœ… Fixed Issues:
Assembly Tab Auto-Loading: C compilation now automatically enables and loads the Assembly tab with generated assembly code
Hex Tab Auto-Loading: Assembly compilation automatically loads the generated hex file into the Hex tab
Custom Hex Decoder: Implemented a processor-specific instruction decoder based on your cpu_core.v with proper opcode mapping, register decoding, and instruction explanations
Simulation File Paths: Added file path labels showing expected Verilog/VVP locations with auto-loading functionality
Tab State Reset: File changes now properly clear all tab content and reset state for a clean workflow
ðŸ”§ Key Improvements:
Seamless workflow chain: C â†’ Assembly â†’ Hex with automatic tab enabling and content loading
Intelligent tab navigation: Can move freely between tabs regardless of entry point
Custom processor integration: Accurate instruction decoding matching your CPU architecture
Clean state management: File changes reset everything for fresh development sessions
Enhanced user experience: Auto-loading, path labels, and smart tab enabling
ðŸš€ Ready to Use:
The IDE is now fully functional and compiled. You can launch it with:

All your workflow requirements have been implemented and the IDE provides a complete, integrated development environment for your custom CPU projects!
