Enhanced Simulation Debug Experience - Complete Implementation
1. CPU Core Logging Enhancements ✅
Added structured logging markers (INSTR_START, INSTR_END, DECODE_FIELDS)
Consistent formatting for PC values, instruction words (IS), and opcodes
Machine-parsable register write logging
Clear instruction boundaries for accurate parsing
2. Multi-Pass Parsing System ✅
Enhanced SimulationLogTab.java with sophisticated parsing logic
Uses instruction markers for accurate instruction identification
Falls back to legacy parsing for backward compatibility
Eliminates duplicate entries and parsing inconsistencies
3. Instruction Details Panel ✅
Detachable instruction details window for multi-monitor debugging
Shows raw instruction word, decoded fields, register states
Updates in real-time as you navigate through instructions
Right-click context menu for easy access
4. Enhanced UI Features ✅
Raw instruction word decoding using InstructionDecoder.decodeFromInstructionWord()
Improved instruction grid with comprehensive information
Status updates showing parsing progress and instruction counts
Better selection handling and navigation
5. Multi-Monitor Debug Workflow ✅
Detachable windows support multiple monitor setups
Instruction details can be moved to secondary display
Main simulation view remains on primary monitor
Enhanced debugging experience for complex instruction analysis
Key Benefits:
Accurate Instruction Tracking: Uses raw instruction words (IS) for precise decoding
Machine-Parsable Logs: Clear markers enable reliable automated parsing
Enhanced Debug Experience: Detachable panels support professional debugging workflows
Backward Compatibility: Falls back to legacy parsing when needed
Comprehensive Information: Before/after register states, raw instruction data, decoded fields
Usage:
Run your simulation - the CPU core will emit enhanced logs with clear markers
Load the simulation log in the UI - it will automatically use the new multi-pass parsing
Right-click any instruction to open the detailed instruction panel
Detach the instruction details window to a secondary monitor for enhanced debugging
Navigate through instructions to see real-time updates of register states and instruction details
The system now provides a professional-grade debugging experience with accurate instruction parsing, comprehensive information display, and multi-monitor support for complex HDL development workflows.


Focus Management Improvements ✅
Changes Made:
Prevented Focus Stealing:

Added setFocusableWindowState(false) to prevent the details window from taking focus
Added setAutoRequestFocus(false) to ensure it doesn't request focus automatically
Modified showInstructionDetails() to show and bring the window to front without stealing focus
Manual Focus Control:

Added a "Focus Window" button in the details panel
Users can click this button if they want to interact with the details window (scroll, select text, etc.)
The button temporarily enables focus and brings the window to the front
Improved User Experience:

Focus remains in the main simulation window for uninterrupted navigation
Details window updates in real-time as you select instructions
Window can be moved to a secondary monitor and continues to work seamlessly
Added repaint() call to ensure proper visual updates
How It Works Now:
Primary Window Workflow:

Click on any instruction in the main simulation log
Details window appears/updates but focus stays in the main window
Continue navigating with arrow keys or mouse clicks
Real-time updates in the details window without interruption
Secondary Window Interaction:

If you need to interact with the details window (copy text, scroll manually, etc.)
Click the "Focus Window" button to enable focus
The details window becomes interactive
Focus management returns to normal window behavior
Multi-Monitor Setup:

Drag the details window to your secondary monitor
Continue debugging on the primary monitor with the main simulation view
Details window updates automatically as you navigate instructions
This provides the best of both worlds: automatic detailed information display without workflow interruption, plus the ability to interact with the details window when needed.
