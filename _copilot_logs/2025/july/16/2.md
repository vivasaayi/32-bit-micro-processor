JMP Handling Analysis Complete
The assembler is correctly handling the JMP instruction in your multiplication program. Here's what I found:

JMP Instruction Analysis:
Hex Encoding: 8000000C
Opcode: 0x20 (OP_JMP) ✓ Correct
Target: mul_loop label
Offset: Encoded as 0x0C (12) in the 9-bit immediate field
Assembly Process:
Label Resolution: The assembler correctly resolves the mul_loop label
Offset Calculation: Computes the relative offset from the current instruction to the target
Encoding: Places the OP_JMP opcode (0x20) in bits [31:26] and the offset in the immediate field
Program Flow:
The multiplication program uses JMP effectively for looping:

Verification:
JMP opcode: 0x20 matches your opcode table ✓
Branch offset: Properly encoded in immediate field ✓
Label resolution: mul_loop and end_mul labels correctly resolved ✓
Conclusion: The assembler is handling JMP instructions correctly, properly resolving labels and encoding branch offsets for program flow control.
