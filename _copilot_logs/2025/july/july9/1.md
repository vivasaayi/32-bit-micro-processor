Summary of the Opcode Encoder Tab
Key Features:
Opcode Selection: Dropdown menu with all supported opcodes (ADD, SUB, LOAD, etc.)
Operand Input: Fields for RD, RS1, RS2, and immediate values
Format Guidance: Shows the correct format for each instruction type
Multiple Output Formats: Hex, binary, assembly, and Verilog testbench code
Smart Format Detection:
ALU Operations: ADD RD, RS1, RS2 format
Memory Operations: LOAD RD, [IMM] and STORE RD, [IMM] formats
Control Operations: JZ [IMM] for branches, PUSH RD for stack ops
System Operations: HALT (no operands)
Output Examples:
For ADD R3, R1, R2:

Hex: 0x00184400
Binary: 00000000000110000100010000000000
Assembly: ADD R3, R1, R2
Verilog: mem[addr] = encode_rrr(6'h00, 5'd3, 5'd1, 5'd2);
Integration:
Added to main CpuIDE as 6th tab (accessible via Ctrl+6)
Follows the same BaseTab structure as other tabs
Includes error handling and validation
Provides status updates and user feedback
Workflow:
Select opcode from dropdown
Enter register numbers (0-31) and immediate values
Click "Encode" or press Enter
Get complete instruction breakdown with all formats
The encoder is now fully integrated and ready to use alongside the decoder tab. You can easily create instructions and then verify them using the decoder tab, making it perfect for CPU development and testing!
