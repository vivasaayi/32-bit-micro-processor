Perfect! The task is now complete. Here's a summary of what has been accomplished:

âœ… Task Complete: Enhanced Simulation Log Debuggability
ðŸŽ¯ Original Requirements
Remove manual button from HexTab - make hex decoding automatic
Show decoded hex table in both HexTab and SimulationLogTab
Parse simulation log to show visual, interactive table of executed instructions
Add register state grid showing one row per instruction with hex/binary/decimal values
Highlight changed registers for easy debugging
ðŸš€ Implemented Features
HexTab Enhancements
âœ… Removed "Disassemble" button - hex is now decoded automatically on load
âœ… Uses shared InstructionDecoder utility for consistent decoding
âœ… Clean, streamlined interface
SimulationLogTab - New Interactive Debugging
âœ… Decoded Instructions Table: Shows PC, OpCode, Mnemonic, RD, RS1, RS2, IMM, Description
âœ… Live Register Display Panel: Shows current register values in hex, binary, and decimal
âœ… Register History Grid: One row per instruction showing register values after execution
âœ… Interactive Navigation: Click any instruction or history row to see register state
âœ… Visual Highlighting:
Changed registers highlighted in green in current display
Changed register cells highlighted in yellow in history grid
âœ… Robust Log Parsing: Handles large values, sign extension, and various log formats
Shared Infrastructure
âœ… InstructionDecoder Utility: Centralized instruction decoding logic
âœ… Consistent UI: Both tabs use same decoding and display patterns
ðŸ”§ Code Quality
âœ… Clean Code: Removed all unused imports and variables
âœ… No Compilation Errors: All files compile cleanly
âœ… Proper Error Handling: Robust parsing with fallbacks
âœ… Modern Java: Uses lambda expressions with proper parameter handling
ðŸŽ¨ User Experience
Effortless Debugging: No manual steps needed - everything is automatic
Rich Visual Feedback: Color-coded changes make it easy to track register modifications
Interactive Exploration: Click to navigate through instruction execution history
Multiple Views: See data in hex, binary, and decimal formats simultaneously
The Java Swing-based CPU IDE now provides a comprehensive, interactive debugging experience that makes it easy to understand CPU execution flow and register state changes during simulation. The enhanced debuggability will significantly improve the CPU development workflow!
