I see you added a singlt line and when I click on the decoded instuction you update the row dynamically.

This is really good and I want to keep this. After seeing this, I felt like, why cant we just render them as small text boxes/labels, and each showing the Hex, binary and decimal value.

In addution to thism can you add obe nore grid, similar to the above one. But we will show  one row per instruction. That way, i will have N rows matching the N opcodes executed. I can also see what records changed between executions eaily.
