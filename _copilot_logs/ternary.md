🎉 Ternary Operator Implementation Complete!
✅ Successfully Implemented Full Ternary Operator Support
New Features Implemented:

1. Lexical Analysis
✅ Added TOK_QUESTION (?) and TOK_COLON (:) tokens
✅ Proper tokenization of ternary operator symbols
✅ Token type string representation for debugging
2. Abstract Syntax Tree
✅ Added AST_TERNARY_OP node type
✅ Ternary operator structure with three children:
children[0] = condition expression
children[1] = true expression
children[2] = false expression
✅ create_ternary_op() function for AST construction
✅ Pretty printing support for ternary operators
3. Parser
✅ Correct precedence: Ternary between assignment and logical OR
✅ Right associativity: a ? b : c ? d : e → a ? b : (c ? d : e)
✅ Syntax validation: Requires both ? and : tokens
✅ Error handling: Clear error messages for malformed ternary
✅ Recursive parsing: Supports nested ternary expressions
4. Type Checking
✅ Condition validation: Must be numeric type (int, float, char)
✅ Branch compatibility: True and false expressions must be compatible types
✅ Result type: Common type of true/false expressions
✅ Error reporting: Clear type error messages
5. Code Generation
✅ Conditional branching: Efficient if-else assembly pattern
✅ Label management: Unique labels for nested ternary operators
✅ Register efficiency: Proper register allocation
✅ Assembly structure:
Test Results:
✅ Basic Ternary: int max = (a > b) ? a : b; ✅ Nested Ternary: (x < y) ? ((x < z) ? x : z) : ((y < z) ? y : z) ✅ Complex Expressions: Ternary with arithmetic, arrays, function calls ✅ Type Safety: Proper error detection for invalid conditions ✅ Integration: Works seamlessly with existing features (arrays, functions)

Generated Assembly Quality:
Efficient conditional branching with minimal overhead
Proper label generation prevents conflicts in nested expressions
Clean register usage following existing conventions
Clear comments for debugging
Language Completeness Impact:
The ternary operator addition significantly enhances the compiler's C language support:

Conditional expressions: Essential C idiom now supported
Code brevity: Allows concise conditional assignments
Functional style: Enables expression-oriented programming patterns
Real-world compatibility: Many C codebases use ternary extensively
Examples Now Supported:
The C compiler now supports a comprehensive set of C expressions including the essential ternary conditional operator! 🚀
