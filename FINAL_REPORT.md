- **ALU**: Arithmetic and logical operations unit
- **Control Unit**: Instruction fetch, decode, and execute logic
- **Register File**: 8 general-purpose 8-bit registers
- **Memory Controller**: 64KB addressable memory space
- **Memory Management Unit (MMU)**: Virtual memory support
- **I/O Peripherals**: UART, Timer, GPIO, Interrupt Controller

### Instruction Set Architecture
- **Arithmetic**: ADD, SUB, ADC, SBC
- **Logic**: AND, OR, XOR, NOT
- **Memory**: LOAD, STORE, LOADI (Load Immediate)
- **Control**: JMP, JEQ, JNE, JLT, JGE, JCS, JCC
- **System**: HALT, NOP, EI, DI, SYSCALL
- **Stack**: PUSH, POP, CALL, RET

## Major Achievements

### 1. Complete System Implementation ✅

- Proper module hierarchy and interconnections
- SystemVerilog compatible code

### 2. Assembler Development ✅
- Created Python-based assembler for the processor
- Supports labels, immediate values, and full instruction set
- Generates hex files for memory initialization
- **Critical Fix**: Corrected instruction encoding mismatch between assembler and CPU

### 3. Comprehensive Testing ✅
- Individual component testing (ALU, registers, memory, etc.)
- Integration testing of complete system
- Test programs ranging from simple to comprehensive
- Successful execution verification

### 4. Debugging and Verification ✅
- Identified and resolved instruction encoding issues
- Created debug utilities for instruction analysis
- Verified correct program execution through simulation
- Confirmed arithmetic operations and program flow

## Test Results

### Simple Test Program
```
Program: Load 5 → R0, Load 15 → R1, Add R0+R1, Output result, Halt
Result: ✅ SUCCESS - R0=20, R1=15, Program halted correctly
```

### Comprehensive Test Program  
```
Program: Multiple arithmetic, logic, and memory operations
Result: ✅ SUCCESS - All operations executed correctly
```

### Advanced Features Tested
- Memory addressing and data storage
- Register file operations
- Arithmetic and logical operations
- Program control flow (jumps, halts)
- I/O operations (GPIO output)
