# Goal
We should move to the RISC Assembly Standard.

Context: We started with a custom assembly language and custom core. Later we pivoted to RISCV standard.

So, we should make sure that we are meeting all the RISCV standard (assembly language, processor, ISA).

Earlier we have created a lot of assembly programs. 

We need to verify each of them to RISCV assembly.
