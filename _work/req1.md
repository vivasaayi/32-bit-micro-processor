I need the capability to execute assemblies generated by otehr tools, or other c compoilers.

What I faced in reality is, there are a ton of tools, and often a beginner finds it hard to explore the landscape and get things done.

So, I want to have my own assemblers, and C Compilers - which I know is hard - but it will help with tools exhaustion and just focus on the problem.

if we dont have these compiler and assembler, honestly, I would not have made this progress,

So, compatibility is Key, following standards is key, but we will have our own implementation, even if that takes a lot of effort, We will start small make sure our test programs execute and then increase the horizon. Also I belive, for most small hobby projects this should be ehough.

Remember, we need to run Linux - thats our northstar
